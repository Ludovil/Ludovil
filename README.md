Bonjour! I'm Ludo, a passionate software developer based in Berlin, Germany, with a love for crafting web applications. Over the past year, I've been on an exciting journey of learning and growth, and I'm thrilled to share my progress with you.

- I recently completed a comprehensive one-year online course by [Digital Career Institute](https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/), where I delved into the world of web development.
- My journey started with the basics: **HTML** and **CSS**, the building blocks of the web.
- I quickly advanced to **JavaScript** and explored its vast potential for creating dynamic and interactive web experiences.
- With **React**, I honed my front-end skills and gained expertise in building modern, responsive user interfaces.
- On the backend, I harnessed the power of **Node.js** and **MongoDB**, mastering the **MERN** stack for full-stack web development.
- I'm proud to have culminated my learning journey with a **collaborative group project**, where my team and I successfully applied the MERN stack to create a web application that showcases our skills and creativity. See the project [here](https://github.com/Ludovil/dci_final_project).
